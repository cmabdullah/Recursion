For example, a card game which requires its cards to be divided equally among up to 5 players requires at least 60 cards, the number at the intersection of the 2, 3, 4 and 5 sets, but not the 7 set.*

* 2. Write a function that takes in a base and an exp and recursively computes baseexp. You are not allowed to use the ** operator!

* 3. Write a function using recursion to print numbers from n to 0.

* 4. Write a function using recursion to print numbers from 0 to n (you just need to change one line in the program of problem 1).

* 5. Write a function using recursion that takes in a string and returns a reversed copy of the string. The only string operation you are allowed to use is string concatenation.

* 6. Write a function using recursion to check if a number n is prime (you have to check whether n is divisible by any number below n).

* 7. Write a recursive function that takes in one argument n and computes Fn, the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the relation
Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2

* Q4. Outline, but do not implement, a recursive solution for generating all subsets of the set {1, 2, . . . , n}.

* Q5. Write a recursive definition of xn, where n ≥ 0, similar to the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers.
Hint: How do you compute xn from xn – 1? How does the recursion terminate?

* Q6. Write a recursive definition of n! = 1 × 2 × . . . × n, similar to the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers.

* 4. Find the sum of the integers from 1 through n. Use recursion.
* 5. Find the product of the integers from 1 through n (this is called the factorial function).
If n is zero, return 1. Use recursion.
* 6. Count the number of zeros in an array of integers. Use recursion.
* 7. Find the minimum element in an array of integers. Use recursion.
* 8. Write a function for mutliply(a, b), where a and b are both positive integers, but you
can only use the + or − operators.
* 9. Find Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 2 numbers using recursion.
* 10. Write a recursive function to reverse a string. Write a recursive function to reverse
the words in a string, i.e., ”cat is running” becomes ”running is cat”.
* 11. A word is considered elfish if it contains the letters: e, l, and f in it, in any order. For example, we would say that the following words are elfish: whiteleaf, tasteful, unfriendly, and waffles, because they each contain those letters. Write a function that, given a word, tells us if that word is elfish or not.  Hard  version: Write another function x-ish, that, given two words, returns true if all the letters of the first word are
contained in the second.
